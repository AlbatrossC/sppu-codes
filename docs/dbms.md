### ‚ùì Question 1:

SQL Queries:

‚Ä¢ Design and Develop SQL DDL statements which demonstrate the use of SQL objects such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym, different constraints etc.

‚Ä¢ Write at least 10 SQL queries on the suitable database application using SQL DML statements.

Note: Instructor will design the queries which demonstrate the use of concepts like Insert, Select, Update, Delete with operators, functions, and set operator etc.

### ‚ùì Question 2:

SQL Queries ‚Äì all types of Join, Sub-Query and View:

Write at least 10 SQL queries for suitable database application using SQL DML statements.

Note: Instructor will design the queries which demonstrate the use of concepts like all types of Join, Sub-Query and View.

### ‚ùì Question 4:

Unnamed PL/SQL code block: Use of Control structure and Exception handling is mandatory.

Suggested Problem statement:

Consider Tables:
  1. Borrower (Roll_no, Name, Date_of_Issue, Name_of_Book, Status)
  2. Fine (Roll_no, Date, Amt)

‚Ä¢ Accept Roll_no and Name_of_Book from user.
‚Ä¢ Check the number of days (from Date_of_Issue).
‚Ä¢ If days are between 15 to 30 then fine amount will be Rs 5 per day.
‚Ä¢ If no. of days > 30, per day fine will be Rs 50 per day and for days less than 30, Rs. 5 per day.
‚Ä¢ After submitting the book, status will change from I to R.
‚Ä¢ If condition of fine is true, then details will be stored into fine table.
‚Ä¢ Also handles the exception by named exception handler or user define exception handler.

OR

MongoDB ‚Äì Aggregation and Indexing:
‚Ä¢ Design and Develop MongoDB Queries using aggregation and indexing with suitable example using MongoDB.

MongoDB ‚Äì Map-reduce operations:
‚Ä¢ Implement Map-reduce operation with suitable example using MongoDB.

### ‚ùì Question 5:

Exporting and Importing Data:

‚Ä¢ Design and develop SQL DML statements to demonstrate exporting tables to external files of different file formats such as CSV, XLSX, TXT, etc.

‚Ä¢ Design and develop SQL DML statements to demonstrate importing data from external files of different file formats such as CSV, XLSX, TXT, etc.

### ‚ùì Question 6:

Cursors (All types: Implicit, Explicit, Cursor FOR Loop, Parameterized Cursor):

Write a PL/SQL block of code using parameterized Cursor that will merge the data available in the newly created table N_Roll_Call with the data available in the table O_Roll_Call. If the data in the first table already exists in the second table then that data should be skipped.

Note: Instructor will frame the problem statement for writing PL/SQL block using all types of Cursors in line with above statement.
