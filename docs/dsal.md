### ❓ Question 6:

Beginning with an empty binary search tree, construct a binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing the binary tree:
i. Insert a new node
ii. Find the number of nodes in the longest path from root
iii. Find the minimum data value in the tree
iv. Change the tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node
v. Search for a value

### ❓ Question 13:

Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the prominent landmarks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.

### ❓ Question 14:

There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight takes to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The node can be represented by the airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.

### ❓ Question 19:

A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword.
