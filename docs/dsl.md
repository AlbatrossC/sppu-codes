### ❓ Question 4:

Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based on a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following: D 100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for withdraw and deposit) D means deposit while W means withdrawal.

### ❓ Question 19:

Department of Computer Engineering has a student club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students of second, third, and final year of the department can be granted membership on request. Similarly, one may cancel the membership of the club. The first node is reserved for the president of the club, and the last node is reserved for the secretary. Write a C++ program to maintain the club members' information using a singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to: a) Add and delete the members as well as the president or secretary. b) Compute the total number of club members. c) Display members. d) Concatenate two linked lists for two divisions.

## 📂 GROUP E

---

### ❓ Question 29:

Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write a C++ program for simulating a job queue. Write functions to add a job and delete a job from the queue.

### ❓ Question 30:

Write a program to implement a priority queue in C++ using an inorder list to store the items in the queue. Create a class that includes the data items (which should be template) and the priority (which should be int). The inorder list should contain these objects, with operator <= overloaded so that the items with highest priority appear at the start of the list (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item).

### ❓ Question 31:

A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be made at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a one-dimensional array. Write a C++ program to simulate a deque with functions to add and delete elements from either end of the deque.
