Understanding the Code

Snippet 1: Point Structure

struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

This structure Point is defined to store the x and y coordinates of a point, which will be used to represent the vertices of the polygon.

Snippet 2: drawPolygon Function

void drawPolygon(const vector<Point>& points) {
    int n = points.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        line(
            points[i].x, points[i].y, 
            points[(i + 1) % n].x, points[(i + 1) % n].y
        );
    }
}

drawPolygon function takes a vector of Point objects as input and draws the polygon by connecting consecutive vertices using the line function from the graphics.h library.  (i + 1) % n ensures that the last vertex connects back to the first, closing the polygon.

Snippet 3: scanlineFill Function (Part 1)

void scanlineFill(const vector<Point>& points, int fillColor) {
    int n = points.size();
    int yMin = INT_MAX, yMax = INT_MIN;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        yMin = min(yMin, points[i].y);
        yMax = max(yMax, points[i].y);
    }

    for (int y = yMin; y <= yMax; y++) { // Iterate through scanlines
        vector<int> intersections;
        // ... (rest of the scanlineFill function will be explained later)

scanlineFill function implements the scan-line fill algorithm. It takes the polygon vertices and the desired fill color as input.

It first determines the minimum and maximum y-coordinates (yMin, yMax) of the polygon. These define the range of scanlines.

The outer loop iterates through each horizontal scanline from yMin to yMax.

Snippet 4: scanlineFill Function (Part 2)

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // Find intersections
            int x1 = points[i].x, y1 = points[i].y;
            int x2 = points[(i + 1) % n].x, y2 = points[(i + 1) % n].y;

            if (y1 > y2) {
                swap(x1, x2);
                swap(y1, y2);
            }

            if (y >= y1 && y < y2 && y2 != y1) { // Check for intersection
                int xIntersect = x1 + (y - y1) * (x2 - x1) / (y2 - y1);
                intersections.push_back(xIntersect);
            }
        }

The inner loop iterates through each edge of the polygon.

It checks if the current scanline (y) intersects with the current edge.  The intersection point's x-coordinate (xIntersect) is calculated using the line equation.

Intersections are added to the intersections vector.

Snippet 5: scanlineFill Function (Part 3)

        sort(intersections.begin(), intersections.end());

        for (size_t i = 0; i < intersections.size(); i += 2) {
            if (i + 1 < intersections.size()) {
                line(intersections[i], y, intersections[i + 1], y); 
                setcolor(fillColor);
            }
        }
    }
}

The intersections are sorted in ascending order of x-coordinates.

Pairs of intersection points (representing line segments inside the polygon) are used to draw horizontal lines using the line function, effectively filling the polygon scanline by scanline.

setcolor sets the drawing color.

Snippet 6: main Function

int main() {
    int gd = DETECT, gm;
    initgraph(&gd, &gm, "");

    // ... (Input and drawing code, explained below)

    getch();
    closegraph();
    return 0;
}

Initializes the graphics system using initgraph.

getch() waits for a key press.

closegraph() closes the graphics window.

Snippet 7: Input and Drawing in main

    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of vertices of the polygon: ";
    cin >> n;

    vector<Point> points(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << "Enter x and y for point " << i + 1 << ": ";
        cin >> points[i].x >> points[i].y;
    }

    setcolor(WHITE);
    drawPolygon(points);

    scanlineFill(points, RED);

Prompts the user for the number of vertices (n).

Takes input for the x and y coordinates of each vertex.

Sets the drawing color to white.

Calls drawPolygon to draw the outline of the polygon.

Calls scanlineFill to fill the polygon with the specified color (RED).


Main Function Execution Flow



The program initializes the graphics system.



It prompts the user to enter the number of vertices and their coordinates.



The drawPolygon function is called to draw the polygon's outline.



The scanlineFill function is called to fill the polygon.



The function determines yMin and yMax.

The outer loop iterates through each scanline (y-value) from yMin to yMax.

The inner loop finds the intersection points of the scanline with polygon edges.

The intersection points are sorted.

Horizontal lines are drawn between pairs of intersection points to fill the polygon on the current scanline.



The program waits for a key press (getch()) before closing the graphics window.



Summary




The code demonstrates the scan-line fill algorithm for filling polygons.

It uses the graphics.h library for graphics operations.

Key concepts covered include polygon representation, line drawing, intersection calculations, and the scan-line fill algorithm itself.  This algorithm is a fundamental topic in Computer Graphics syllabus of SPPU. It covers topics like basic graphics primitives, algorithms, and data structures used in 2D graphics programming.

The program takes user input for the polygon vertices, making it interactive.

The use of a Point structure helps organize the vertex data efficiently.
